  <h3>JavaScript vs Typescript</h3>
  <small><code>recently updated</code></small>

    <div>
      <h4>JavaScript</h4>
      <p>JavaScript is a scripting language explicitly designed for web development. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The application doesn’t need to interact with hardware since all actions happen in the browser.</p>
      <p>The main reason for using JavaScript is the desire to build fast, responsive, and highly interactive pages.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Typescript</h4>
      <p>
        Typescript can be described as an improved version of JavaScript with increased readability, static compilation, intuitive interface, and typing. The purpose behind creating Typescript was to simplify the development process and help developers deliver a cleaner codebase. It’s a superset of JavaScript, not a standalone language.
      </p>
      <p>The main difference of TypeScript is that it’s strongly-typed or that it supports static typing. That means Static typing allows checking type correctness at the compile time. This is not available in JavaScript.</p>
    </div>

  <div>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>TypeScript is a modern age JavaScript development language whereas JavaScript is a scripting language which helps you create interactive web pages. TypeScript uses concepts like types and interfaces to describe data being used whereas no such concept is available with JavaScript.</p>
    <p>if an experienced developer is working on relatively small coding projects, then JavaScript is ideal. However, if you have knowledge and expertise development team, then Typescript is a most preferred option</p>
